This project uses real time API from GitHub and automated Rest API testing with REST Assured. I have successfully implemented the following HTTP methods:
	• POST – Create a repository
	• GET – Retrieve repository details
	• PUT – Update repository description
	• DELETE – Remove repository
These operations are fully automated using the Cucumber framework integrated with TestNG, and include:
	• Reusable step definitions
	• @Before and @After hooks for setup and teardown
	• Configuration handled via external property files
	• Logging for request/response tracking
	• HTML test reports generation


This project serves as a reusable template for REST API automation using modern BDD practices and can be extended for future use cases.
